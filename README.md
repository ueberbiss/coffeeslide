# CoffeeSlide

## Responsive HTML5 Full Page Content Slider jQuery powered)

CoffeeSlide is a full page HTML5 content slider built with CoffeeScript + jQuery; It is fully Responsive by it's own (doesn't need any plugins) and it supports all browsers.

### Usage:

Inculde the **HTML5-shim** in your webpage's head

    <!--[if lt IE 9]>
      <script src="http://html5shim.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"></script>
    <![endif]-->

Then include the slider's css (in the head too):

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/coffeeslide.min.css">

Note that the non-minified version of the file has two comments guiding you about basic things you might want to change: the height of the transparent overlay where your content reside (which is dynamic by default) and other important styles of that same overlay.

Include jQuery and the slider's script before closing your body tag:

    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"></script>  
    <script src="js/coffeeslide.min.js"></script>

And you're good to go...

Use the HTML 5 Skeleton of the included demo to create your own page... Note that the slider will adapt to it's container width so if you want it to be responsive, you need to set the container's width to a percentage instead of a fixed *px measure.

You can place any HTML code and/or content in your slides and have as many slides as you want.  

That's all!
